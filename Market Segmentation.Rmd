## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Control randomness
```{r}
set.seed(1234)
```

# Load Data
```{r}
data = read.csv("HubwayTrips.csv")
```

# Normalize the data 
```{r}
install.packages("caret",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(caret)
```

#Normalizing data. All means =0 and SD =1
```{r}
preproc = preProcess(data)
HubwayNormalized = predict(preproc,data)
summary(HubwayNormalized)
sd(HubwayNormalized$Duration)
```
```{r}
KmeansClustering = kmeans(HubwayNormalized, centers = 10)
table(KmeansClustering$cluster)

```
# Average ride duration in each cluster
```{r}
tapply(data$Duration, KmeansClustering$cluster,mean)
```

# Cluster analysis
```{r}
tapply(data$Morning, KmeansClustering$cluster, mean)
```
```{r}
tapply(data$Afternoon, KmeansClustering$cluster, mean)
```
```{r}
tapply(data$Evening, KmeansClustering$cluster, mean)
```
```{r}
tapply(data$Night, KmeansClustering$cluster, mean)
```
```{r}
tapply(data$Weekday, KmeansClustering$cluster, mean)
```

```{r}
tapply(data$Weekend, KmeansClustering$cluster, mean)
```

```{r}
tapply(data$Male, KmeansClustering$cluster, mean)
```

```{r}
tapply(data$Age, KmeansClustering$cluster, mean)
```

# An interesting observation is that several clusters stick out as  commuter trips (clusters 5, 7, 8, 10). Clusters 3, 4, and 9 are interesting since they are on weekdays, but occur mostly during the afternoon. This indicates that the riders might be students (cluster 3 and 4) or maybe retired riders (cluster 9). Clusters 1, 2, and 6 look like leisurely weekend trips, which is interesting since Hubway is more typically used for short trips, and could be a business/marketing opportunity
